## Comments

It is important to allow developers to comment on/in their source files for 
clarity and maintainability of their code. In `SLang`, both single-line 
and multi-line comments are supported.


#### Single-line comment
```c
; Single line comment here
x = 5 + 6;
```

#### Multi-line comment
```

```
