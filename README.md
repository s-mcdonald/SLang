### Core Goals
* **Ease of Learning**: Even simpler than Lua, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.
* **Fast Compilation**: Prioritizes blazing-fast compilation times to enhance development flow and productivity.
* **Automatic Memory Management**: Includes built-in garbage collection for safe and efficient memory handling.
* **Direct Compilation**: Compiles directly to machine code for optimal performance in applications.

SLang aims to bridge the gap between simplicity and performance, providing developers with a powerful toolset for building robust and maintainable systems.
